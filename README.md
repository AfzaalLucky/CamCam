# CamCam
Face Detection software written in C#


The goal of this project is to design a graphical user interface and implement the Viola Jones algorithm that allows the user to detect faces in images and/or via Webcam. The structure of this project allows to understand how a machine can process image to recognize a face in an image. The graphical user interface involves an image box on the left to show the processed picture and a right panel which contain many detection parameters that can be adjusted to improve face detection. This software is written in C# and implemts the library EmguCV.

##EmguCV

Emgu CV is a cross platform .Net wrapper to the OpenCV image processing library. Allowing OpenCV functions to be called from .NET compatible languages such as C#, VB, VC++, IronPython etc. The wrapper can be compiled by Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio and Unity, it can run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

##Configuration

This program was developped using :

+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
+ OpenCV 2.2.0
+ EmguCV 2.2.1.1150 - [Download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/emgucv/files/emgucv/2.2.1/)
